                        You must gather materials, farm mushrooms, and brew potions to regain your memory. (And, maybe, seek revenge.)

                        We made this simple, cozy farming game in two weeks with the prompt ‘Shadows and Alchemy’. 
                        This was my second project made in Godot after my capstone project, and I got a much better feel for the engine while working on this game. 
                        My friend <a class="external-link-itch-soupythecat" href="/" target="_blank">SoupyTheCat</a> helped with the game design and made all of the game’s audio. 
                        She even played the flute for the music track!

                    <p>
                        We were initially hoping to make a game with a farming mechanic and an automation mechanic to fit the alchemy theme.
                        Just making the art and code for the farming mechanic took long enough that we soon scrapped the automation idea and instead built a simple terraria-style crafting system.
                        Changing direction like this is pretty common in game jams and game design in general, as you often run into issues with scope and development time, thus having to choose what to prioritize.
                    </p>
                    <p class="project-margin-20-top">
                        At the start of the game, the player will wander about and pick up materials from the forest floor.
                        Then the player can craft farming tools and begin farming mushrooms to eventually make a magical potion that will offer them a form of enlightenment.
                        The game has a simple story with narration at the beginning and end, and the game takes 10-15 minutes to complete.

                    <p>
                        I chose to draw the art for this game digitally, as I only had two weeks and I wanted to work as fast as possible.
                        I spent the longest time drawing the floor tiles and the player character, and many things I had planned didn’t make it by the deadline. (Like, any animations at all…)
                        However, I’m quite pleased with how the game’s UI turned out! This was my first time designing an inventory system and I think it ended up being pretty cohesive.

                        Since this was my second game with Godot, I had a playable prototype in a couple of days and development went pretty smoothly.
                        Godot is naturally dynamically typed, but I learned how to tweak the settings to behave as though it was typed statically which helped speed up development.
                        I also began learning and implementing the software principle of “composition” properly, allowing all of the different items and tiles to be created quickly using shared components.
                        This game is my most complex project <i>mechanically speaking</i>, and I’m still using lots of this game's code in my current project!
