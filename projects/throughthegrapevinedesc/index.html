                        This is an art piece that I made traditionally with pen and ink and then arranged digitally to make it repeat infinitely.
                        I carefully designed square pieces of art so that certain edges would fit together and repeat on themselves.
                        The drawings are 4 inches by 4 inches each, and there are 6 squares total as you can see below.

                        On the coding side of things, I have a list of all of the edge types and what they can link to next.
                        Each time a new square is added, it checks for an available edge type to follow it.
                        The program also checks how often certain squares appear, so that it avoids repeating the same exact sequence over and over.
                        This program could easily be expanded upon into a much larger project, which is something that I would like to do in the future!
