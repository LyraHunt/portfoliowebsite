# portfoliowebsite
 
Repo for my portfolio site:
wildehuntgames.com

This site was created from scratch with HTML, CSS, and (a lot of) Javascript. The domain is provided by porkbun.com, and the site is hosted with Github Pages. Most of the site's general coding is finished, and now I'm working on adding my previous projects and writing articles on how the projects were created. Mobile responsiveness is still in the works, sorry if it's hard to navigate right now!
